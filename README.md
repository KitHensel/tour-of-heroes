#Tour of Heroes

My first Angular2 app.

The Tour of Heroes tutorial takes us through the steps of creating an Angular application in TypeScript.

Our grand plan is to build an app to help a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes. Even heroes need to find work.

Of course we'll only make a little progress in this tutorial. What we do build will have many of the features we expect to find in a full-blown, data-driven application: acquiring and displaying a list of heroes, editing a selected hero's detail, and navigating among different views of heroic data.
